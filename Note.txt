Make a C++ code 
1st task is to create a integer array composing of 10 elements with values ranging from 20 to 60 make sure that it is unsorted
, using a for loop to display the content of the array

2nd task (connected sa 1st stack) create a container a stack and queue that can store the initial array from the 1st task, afterwards make it .pop 3 times
and display the content remaining of the stack and queue

3rd task 

Make a C++ Code:

1st Task: 10pts
1. Create an integer array composing 10 element with values ranging from 20 to 60 (UNSORTED)
2. Display the elements using a for loop

2nd Task: 10pts (Connected to the 1st task)
1. Create a stack and queue that can store the initial array from the 1st task
2. Use 'pop' 3 times the elements in stack and queue
3. Display the final content of the stack and queue

Make sure that the array is empty using a "!" function

3rd Task: 10pts
1. Combine all the content of stack and queue into a single container (Stack will be the first array to be shown) then queue 
(call data merging then print)

4th Task: 20pts
1. Make 4 sorting algoriths that can be called using void function
2. Insert the elements of data merging into the sorting algorithms

5th Task: 10pts
1. Between running the 4 running algorithms average the time complexity of them using miliseconds for each algorithms
1. Apply chrono function to estimate the time complexity of each sorting algorithms

9:45 TIME OUT

3 Decimal Microseconds for time complexity

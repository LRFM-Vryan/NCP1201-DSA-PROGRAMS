// This program demonstrates how to take input from the user in C++
// It prompts the user to enter their name, reads the input using 'cin',
// and then greets the user by printing "Hello, [name]" to the console.
// You can run this program and enter different names to see how it works.
// Make sure to include the necessary header and use the standard namespace.Bry
